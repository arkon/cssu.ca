By: Anujan M, Clara S and the CSSU Team

First and foremost on behalf of the CSSU I would like to congratulate you on getting an acceptance into CS here at UofT St. George. (If not - well, we hope you are considering it or we hope you get an acceptance). This is a collection of FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) that I think all first years (and everyone at CS here) should know. University is daunting, especially coming into it for the first time. I hope this guide gives you a lot of information and tips to make sure that you are successful (and makes you laugh along the way). If there is anything you want to add or edit on this guide, send us a quick email.

## What is the CSSU?

So since this is made in coordination with the CSSU I would like to introduce you to them. The Computer Science Student Union, or CSSU for short, represents all Computer Science students who are either taking a Computer Science course or are part of a Computer Science POSt at the University of Toronto St. George campus. They offer a variety of services and events. They sell drinks and snacks out of their office in BA2250 and run lots events including our popular Games Night where students have the opportunity to socialize with classmates over games, of all kinds, all night long. We also have lots of video game and consoles in the office from the Gamecube (for Smash Bros.) to the Switch (Smash Bros 2018) and an Xbox One and Playstation 3 for you to play with your friends and make new ones. Feel free to drop by say hello and introduce yourselves. Also they run CS Frosh which happens at the beginning of the year for students to get to know each other and give some great info. Stay Tuned for more Details Later this Summer.

## Common Terms that you should know

 - ACORN
   - ACORN is your one stop shop for all the official things you need to do. From enrolling in courses, finding your tuition bills, and where you find your final grades ACORN is your go to site. ProTip: You can plan your courses on acorn and save them to your "cart" where you can quickly enrol in them when it's time to enrol in courses.


 - QUERCUS (A.K.A. Portal or the most unpronounceable name on campus)
   - QUERCUS replaces the old blackboard system that most courses (for the exception of most cs courses) uses to give notes, important dates, submit assignments sometimes and get your term marks. CS courses tend to use their own sites but most of the other courses do use it. If you've used D2L or Blackboard then you'll find the system a bit familiar.


 - Markus
   - So QUERCUS/Blackboard is used for non-cs courses, Markus is where you'll be submitting your work and getting feedback and marks for most (if not all) cs courses. Make sure you can login to the site (it uses your teaching labs password which may/may not be the same as your uoft password) when it’s available to avoid hassles if you can't login the day the assignment is due. ProTip: Always submit assignments early since during the last few min of the deadline the system tends to get overloaded and may be slow/crash, it’s your responsibility to submit early.


 - Piazza
   - Piazza is what a lot of courses use as a course forum where people can post questions and get answers from classmates and even professors/TA's. It’s a good resource to find answers to frequently asked clarifications though remember to search before asking.


 - Teaching Labs (aka CDF)
   - The teaching labs refer to not only the actual labs in bahen but the whole system where you are interacting with the department (Markus, SSH, PCRS). At the beginning of the year you'll get an email to set up your account. Its very important that 1) you don't lose the email and 2) don't forget the password you set it with. This is the most used login you'll need at UOFT (after your UTORID login for ACORN)


 - Help Center
   - One of the best places to get official help the CS Help Center located in Bahen has TA's and professors ready to help you when you have questions. For a full schedule of when its open and who's there visit [this link](http://web.cs.toronto.edu/program/ugrad/ug_helpcentre.htm). Getting help is really important make full use of these hours.


 - Undergrad Office
   - For all your official program questions and concerns make your way up to the 4th floor to visit the undergrad office for cs. You can ask them questions from POST to finance questions and anything to do with the CS program and they're always willing to help you out. If you need any CS advice the office is a great place to get the official answers to all/most of your questions.

## Course Enrollment

So the first rule of CS is to be lazy (when coding) and don’t remake the wheel (or the print statement) so since the Faculty of Arts and Science already videotaped, asked and subtitled videos on how course enrolment works and great tips I’m just going to link them here. These star some of the best CS students I’ve ever had the pleasure of knowing and their advice is actually really great. Stars Former CSSU General Council Member, TA and Frosh Organizer Lana, Current CSSU Vice President, UofT Hacks President and TA Calvin and Former TA Felipe.

## Course Tips

#### CSC108 vs CSC148

So many students ask whether they can skip CSC108 and just do CSC148. The answer is really dependent on your ability, and you won’t be favored for POSt if you take CSC148 during first semester vs second semester. If you’re new to programming, you should definitely consider doing CSC108, as it’s for beginners and will give you the required preparation you need to do CSC148. If you’re experienced with programming, you might want to talk with someone at the undergrad office to see if you will benefit from skipping CSC108. If you do end up directly progressing to CSC148, there are ramp-up sessions held during the beginning of the semester to help you brush up on the contents of 108. Alternatively, you could also take a look at a past final from 108 on the old exam repository, or look at the ramp up slides online to get an overview of CSC108. If you feel like you don’t understand it completely, you might want to take CSC108. (Think about the best thing for you as a student - It’s about learning the material to the best of your abilities, not about saving a half credit). Both courses are in Python, so even if you’re familiar in Java, you might want to take CSC108 just to get familiar with Python. Consider your options well. One thing to note is that even if you take CSC148 and then decide that you're not ready for it after taking a few classes, you can drop down to CSC108. If you do decide to take CSC108, note that there are three versions of the course which are offered to you.(mastery, online, and in-class) Try and find the one that best suits your experience and your comfort level.

#### Which Math Course Should I take?

So yes, you’re thinking - this is a CS guide! Why is it talking about math courses? Well, mathematics and Computer Science go hand in hand (in particular, CSC165 and all the theory courses have a very mathematical approach). We are much alike with our math counterparts on  the theoretical side. This is the reason why you will have to pick a calculus course on your first year - and your options are highly varied. The courses offered are MAT135/136, MAT137, and MAT157. Either of these will satisfy the program requirements, but 137 and 157 are more theoretically heavy, and great proof preparatory materials. If you are considering a maths specialist, you should take 157. If you want a maths major or a minor, or thinking about it, you should take 137. If you want to take CSC165 in first semester, you must take either 137 or 157 along with it. However, if you are taking it in the second semester, you have the option to take 135/136 as well. 135/136 are two half courses, while 137 and 157 are full-year courses. Do your due diligence and remember that if you take a more advanced course, you can normally try it out and drop down to the lower math courses in the first 2 weeks (or more) with no penalty (the same doesn’t apply going up in difficulty). If you have any concerns, contact the math department. They have also provided some good prep work for calc [here](http://www.math.toronto.edu/preparing-for-calculus/).

#### How should I take notes?

There's no real definitive answer to this question. Many people prefer writing with pen and paper, and it does benefit you in Math courses and Theory courses, where there are lots of complex formulas and mathematical notation to jot down - you probably wouldn’t want to type that out. Lots of people swear by the fact that writing by hand is better, though some people also like typing everything out instead. For programming courses, coding along with the prof is sometimes a great idea to see the lessons in action, though those normally have slides that you can read afterwards to catch up as well. What ever style fits you is the one you should do.

#### What type of laptop do I need?

This is also a question with no definitive answer. Technically, you don’t need one, since you have 24 hours access to the bahen labs, and can write all your assignments there. However, it's recommended that you should get a laptop, if you don’t want be stuck in the labs all the time. You don’t need the most advanced system in the market, and you should get something that fits your needs and budget. 

#### Tips

So you’ve gotten into the courses you like, and you’ve planned out your timetable well. Now, you need to succeed in them. How do you learn the content well, and get a decent grade? Here are the best resources to help you succeed.

1. Attend Lectures
 - Lectures are the main way you are taught the course content, and you shouldn’t be afraid to ask questions during lecture or even before or after the lectures if you don’t understand something. If there are multiple lecturers teaching the same course, try to attend 1 lecture of each lecturer, to see whose style blends with you best (and fits your schedule). However, you should read the syllabus carefully to see if the course is designed in such a way that auditing different lecture sections won’t negatively impact your grade (some courses have lecture section specific midterms, or participation marks which you can only earn in your own lecture section).

2. Attend Tutorials
 - As a former TA, I truly believe that tutorials are the best way to know if you know what you’re doing. During tutorials, you can get lots of practice, ask questions, and get instant feedback from your TA and your peers in a smaller group setting. You should take advantage of your TA whether in 148 or 165. They are paid to help and support you do your best. They also give great advice (cough cough)

3. Office Hours
 - While Office Hours may sound daunting, they are not. Most (if not all) profs love it when students come to office hours with good questions and concerns. Also, if they’re not too busy, you can ask them questions about their research or general CS questions - They are some of the most experienced in the field, and this is a great way to build up a great prof/student relationship which can help you later on.

4. The Help Center
 - As mentioned above, the help center is a great place to ask TAs and profs questions that you may have about the course content and assignments. Keep it in mind that it can get very crowded near a deadline (procrastination at its finest). However, it's still a great way to get help (also, Piazza is an excellent resource if you need any help).

5. Assignments
 - When it comes to assignments, don’t start the day before - that doesn’t only make you extremely stressed, but also gives you no time to ask questions about the assignments if you get stuck. Start early, make a list of questions to ask, and go to office hours to get those questions cleared up. Also, don’t copy off of other students - plagiarism is bad, like - it's serious business. The department has very high tech tools to catch you, and they will - it's never worth it. If something comes up and you need help, talk to your prof and they will try to help you. Also, make sure your code runs on the lab computers (this may sound crazy but people have submitted assignments that error out because (1) they didn’t submit the right file or it had an error, or (2) their computer inputted a random non ascii character and the lab couldn't parse that file, resulting in a 0 because it didn’t run). So, how do you prevent this? It’s simple - submit early, download your code off of markus to a lab computer, and run it! If it runs in the lab, it will run while grading. Even if it runs on your computer fine, that is not a valid reason - IT MUST WORK ON THE LAB COMPUTERS AS WELL. Also, check your language settings on your computer - non-english characters have been known to screw up the file, rendering it un-runnable on the lab computers (its weird, I know - but you should rather be safe than sorry).

## POSt

Ok now for the big CS elephant in the room, POSt. POSt is short form for Program of Study. Here at St. George, the Faculty of Arts and Science has this policy in which it encourages exploration of different fields, and makes it easy for students to switch majors and subjects after their first year. However, you can’t choose your Majors/Minors till the end of First Year. The issue is there are not enough resources/spaces to give every student who wants to choose CS after their first year - so, the Department has to institute a cutoff and requirements for students to get into the CS Specialist, Major or minor.

The requirements as quoted from the Art Sci Calendar is:
This is a limited enrolment program (Type 2L) that can only accommodate a certain number of students. Eligibility is based on the following criteria:

- Completion of at least 4.0 FCEs including CSC148H1 (with a minimum grade of 70%) and CSC165H1/​ CSC240H1 (with a minimum grade of 70%); AND

- An average of the grades in CSC148H1 and CSC165H1/​ CSC240H1 that meets the department's annual cutoff. CSC240H1 grades will be adjusted to account for the course's greater difficulty. 

- Note that the cutoff changes from year to year, depending on the current capacity of the program and the pool of applicants. 

So after reading this, most students panic and ask - “What's the Cutoff?” Well, I wish I could give you an answer, and I wish that the department could give an answer - but its not that easy. The cutoff is not an arbitrary number, say 60 or 75 - like some other subject’s posts. In reality, the cutoff for CS is the top x student averages from 148 and 165 that are applying to the POST, where x is the number of spots in the program for that year. Historically, the cutoffs have been between 75-83. This is high. Is it impossible, no - but is it doable, yes if you put a lot of effort in these courses. There is no reason to be scared, as the instructors are not there to weed students out, but instead, to make sure that you are prepared and that you learn the content well. These two courses are an important base in which if you don't succeed in them, its possible that CS isn't right for you. Always keep your options open. As mentioned in course enrollment section, take some breadth courses and maybe you'll enjoy them and want to pursue them further.

## Mental Health

Mental health is extremely important, and taking care of yourself should be your first priority. A lot of students find POSt to be extremely stressful, and university in general is a giant leap from high school. Taking a reduced course load, or dropping down from hard courses to easier exclusions isn't something to be ashamed of, and you should definitely do it if you feel like it will benefit your mental health. On the same note, Accessibility Services is something you should check out if you are having any mental/physical health related problems which are getting in the way of your studies. It provides amazing support to those who are registered within it. You can get exam accommodations, extensions on assignments (amongst many other things) - and you also get your own advisor whom you can go to if you are having problems coping with University. They will direct you to many resources, and will help you out the best they can.

Another thing which I want to mention is that collaboration and teamwork can help a lot when it comes to dealing with the pressure of assignments and midterms. Yes, POSt is competitive, but helping each other out and learning from each other goes a long way. Make friends!!! Everyone is scared, stressed out, and just wants to do well. Help each other out, and be kind to one another. Please don’t expect to go solo on all your classes - you are surrounded by some of the brightest students in your year, take advantage of that. University is a lot less stressful if you have like minded friends to help you along the way.

## How to get involved?

Having a school/life balance is especially important when you’re in university. While there may be intense pressures from academics, make sure you give time to yourself as well. There are a huge list of clubs and student groups that you can join [check this link](https://www.ulife.utoronto.ca/) or visit the clubs fair during the first week of classes. For more CS related clubs, do check our list of CS clubs [here](https://cssu.ca/clubs/). 

Also, I would recommend considering joining a FLC group. Basically, you get a group of other students who are taking the same Computer Science courses, and an upper year mentor who helps guide you though your courses, uni, and life in general. It also helps you make some friends, be in the know, and get some real mentorship. Check out more info [here](https://learningcommunities.utoronto.ca/index.php/ex-1/find-your-flc/computer-science/).

Also, do take a look at applying to be a First Year Rep here at the CSSU. You can also be a General Council member - check out the main page for more details on how to apply!

There are also lots of events which you can go to and participate in - follow us on Facebook and Instagram to be updated on all the events which the CSSU runs. There are a lot of hackathons which you can join (for those who don’t know what a hackathon is its basically a 1-3 day event where you and a team get together to build something like an app which solves a problem, or just something really cool), and you can win prizes or  get free food!!! Its 95% of the time free, and you get the opportunity to meet lots of company reps. UofT Hacks is our premier hackathon, so be on the lookout for more details later this year. Also, check out [MLH](https://mlh.io/seasons/na-2019/events) for a full list of hackathons. Remember, you don’t have to be experienced to go attend a hackathon - there are lots of workshops, and you can always go for the experience, which I can confirm is awesome.

## Jobs, Internships and PEY

So yes, everyone wants to get experience in the real world and make money - uni is expensive, and living in toronto is expensive. So, a job that actually relates to your studies checks off all those boxes. There are a wide range of job “opportunities” which you can consider. As a first year, definitely look at some of the major company internships that are dedicated to first and second year students - Google’s Engineering Practicum and Microsoft Explore are two of the bigger programs. Also, startups are a great way to get into the door and get some experience (though do your due diligence, because unpaid internships are very uncommon in CS - so make sure you know what you’re getting into before committing). For good interview questions prep, read “Cracking the Coding Interview” (CTCI) its very informative and has lots of problems in it.

If industry is not your cup of tea then there are a lot of research opportunities for students if they are persistent. After your first year, there are 2nd year research programs run by art sci [click for more details] where you can get real research experience and a course credit either in the summer after first year or during your 2nd year. Also there are a lot of open source projects that you can contribute to, both in UofT (PyTA, Markus, …) and outside (Google’s Summer of Code is a great place to find open source projects, and google pays students during the summer for working on them).

PEY (Professional Experience Year) is another option which you can consider after your 2nd year, or after your 3rd year of studies. It's basically a 12-16 month internship where you work at a company (you do have to apply and interview so it's not just giving you a placement) and get some real life experience during your studies. For more information [check out their site](http://engineeringcareers.utoronto.ca/internships-overview/pey/).

- [UofT Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/)
- [CS Career Questions Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/)
- Also read the department emails that you get they have awesome information.

## Finances

So CS is expensive. Since you’re not considered a “Computer Science Student” in first year, you don’t have to pay the unregulated fees. Instead, you pay regular “Art Sci” Fees. However, once you are accepted in the POST, you will face the brunt of CS Fees. Starting from the summer after your first year, your fees are about double the regular tuition fees. These Un-Regulated Fees aren't because UofT wants to take all your money, but because the government believes you can get a great job out of undergrad and be able to pay it all off anyway, so you can afford it (just like engineers and business students). Also, this means (as of writing) that you don’t get “Free Tuition” but enough to pay Art Sci Fees, but you still get loans check with the calculator and plan your finances. Though the good news is you can qualify for UTAPS, the great thing about this program is that you don’t have to do anything after your first year - it justs uses your OSAP data and your family income and other. If your OSAP data is low enough, you can get extra money (free money) paid towards your tuition. The thing is you won’t know this magical amount till late September/early October, though it can be pretty substantial in certain cases $4000+ depending on need. There are also lots of scholarships if you qualify for them (check Google’s or go to the undergrad office for more details). Also, check out your college for more financial aid and scholarships - the registrars are there to help you out.

## Parting Words

Well, you made it to the end of the guide! If you read all of it, congratulations and thank you. If not, well - take a break and come back to read the rest. If you just skipped to the bottom, go back to the top and read (why would you skip to the end, thought there would be a summary of the main points?). I would like to thank all of the people that have helped to contribute to this guide and make this a possibility. From the 2018-2019 CSSU President David Ansermino for his acceptance of this idea and to let me run with it, also a huge thanks to Clara for her fantastic editing for this guide and giving real first hand tips and experience to make this guide as comprehensive and grammatically correct as it can be without her this guide would not be as nicely written as it is. I hope this is informative to you and feel free to share it with people. If you have any suggestions or comments feel free to email the CSSU at (cssu@teach.cs.toronto.edu)

I wish you the best of luck in your first year and hope you make the most of your time here at UofT and I hope to see you at CS Frosh this year.
