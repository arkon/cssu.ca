.LOGOUT is an annual yearbook that used to be released yearly by the CSSU. It included pictures of events and creative submissions made by computer science students. It was a nice way to preserve the present and now enables us to reflect on the past. For that reason, the CSSU is happy to announce that this year .LOGOUT made a digital comeback!
