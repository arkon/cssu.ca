As many of you know the CS POSt is one of the most stressful things for new CS students at St. George. Every year since 2014, there has been a cutoff average between CSC165 and CSC148 that determines the students who get into the POST.

There is a lot of misinformation about why it exists and how it works. We want to give you a full picture, and more data to make sure that you are informed. We hope this information will help you understand the situation better and make choices from a more informed perspective. 

The main reason that we have rigorous admission limitations is a lack of space and a lack of professors. The department lacks the resources in terms of space and time for courses that can fit everyone that is interested, and there is also a shortage of faculty. There is also the instream vs out-of-stream factor. When applying from highschool you were allowed to apply to the CS stream (CMP1); this stream had a higher admission average than most other direct from high school programs at UofT. The problem is you are not "in the program" untill you get into the POST at the end of your first year. (This is why you are not charged deregulated CS Fees in your first year but "general" artsci fees.) Beyond the students who are in-stream (CMP1) any students who has taken CSC165 and CSC148 are allowed to apply to the POST. There are many students who explore CS courses, find that they enjoy it much more than the program they are currently in, and decide to get pursue this field of study. As seen in the chart this is a sizeable number of those who apply to POSt.

The department is taking steps to increase its faculty size and teaching capacity to try and accept more students, but continuously increasing cutoff is only a reflection of the quality and success of students applying. The gist of how these cutoffs are calculated is basically such: Take the top x number of students in decreasing order of their averages between the two courses (where x is the number of spots in the program for the following year).

The following chart was provided after requests to the department for more concrete information. This comparison is between 2017 and 2018's Round 1. As of publishing we didn't get Round 2 for 2018.

(Data Science is included due to the fact that it is a joint program with CS and Stats. This is the first year of it so there is a small cohort.)

Also note that not all students in CMP1 decided to pursue a CS Major/Specialist. 

The following is the number of applications versus offers for the major and specialist program over the years as taken from the [department site](http://web.cs.toronto.edu/program/ugrad/admission.htm). (Note that some of the numbers do not match the table above this has been noted and will be addressed)

There used to be the cutoff averages for those years posted on the department site. The department now feels that this is not indicative of what the average will be in the coming years as noted in reasons above. The cutoff is basically the average of the last student to get into the POST at that given time.

We would like to thank Francois and the department for their help in giving us these numbers and their permission to release them to the public. Francois also talked on last years [Room 2250 Episode](https://soundcloud.com/room-2250/s1e2-the-pitt-questions) about the POST if you want further information.

If we get more information, we will update this post. We hope this has helped you and if you have any feedback feel free to let us know.
