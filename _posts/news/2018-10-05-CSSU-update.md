So hopefully you've been getting into the swing of things, whether your a first year or finishing up your degree on behalf of the CSSU I hope you've been had a great first month back. The CSSU has also been busy this year prepping lots of great events and things for you to make the most of your experience here at UofT.

My goal here is to give you a "one-stop" shop for all the DCS, UofT and interesting news that will hopefully make you aware of whats happing and will happen. Information is spread out through a lot of different locations and hopefully I can bring some really interesting things to your attention. While this won't be fully comprehensive, I think I can try my best :).

This "Blog" will hopefully be published every week and I hope to have lots of interesting content whether guest writers, interviews and mabey a space for readers like you to submit your content.

Without further ado, let's get into everyone's favorite segment the 

## News:

1. From the [CS Department](http://web.cs.toronto.edu/news/current/U_of_T_s_Michelle_Craig_wins_prestigious_OCUFA_teaching_award.htm), Professor Michelle Craig has been named one of Ontario’s most outstanding university teachers by the Ontario Confederation of University Faculty Associations (OCUFA) for the 2017-2018 year. Professor Craig has taught many CS courses at the undergrad level such as CSC343 and CSC209. She is also one of the creators of the PCRS C modules which is used in CSC209 to supplement learning in the course though prepratory videos and excercises. If you see her around please congratulate her on this wonderful achievement.
2. The University of Toronto is currently reviewing all Convocations and a group of CS students has spearheaded a campain to get the universty to add a CS convocation similar to Rotman's and the DCS's 50th anniversary convocation.

3. While it seemed to have been a slow CS news week here at UofT, I thought I would share some "recent" achievements of CS undergrads to possibly inspire you.
4. Samin Khan (4th Year CS Student) this summer won Microsoft's Imagine Cup along with his teammate from UOIT.
